## Description

This is a refracted version of a previous work of coding for Horiseon. This version of coding allows easier reading of the HTML coding by creating different tags for better identification. The CSS stylesheet page has been cleaned up as well; DRY coding has been reduced to a mininum and allows better reading and code identification for selectors in CSS to the assigned tags in HTML.
